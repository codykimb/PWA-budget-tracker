# Budget Tracker

## DESCRIPTION
For this project, I updated an existing budget tracker application to allow for offline access and functionality. The user is now able to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a connection. If the user enters transactions offline, the total updates when they're brought back online. 

I used IndexedDB to add offline functionality. I then added a service worker and a web manifest to covert Budget Tracker to a Progressive Web Appplication.
